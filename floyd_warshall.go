/*
In computer science, the Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm is an algorithm for finding
shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but
with no negative cycles).

A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of
the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

Although it does not return details of the paths themselves, it is possible to
reconstruct the paths with simple modifications to the algorithm.  Versions of
the algorithm can also be used for finding the transitive closure of a relation
R, or (in connection with the Schulze voting system) widest paths between all
pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
